# set-personal-data

A channel to interface with the regional `pd.dat` necessary for many Japanese channels.

You'll need [libunistring](https://github.com/WiiLink24/ppc-libunistring) in order to use this channel.

TODO:
 - implement indexed addresses (is this really needed?)
 - rewrite to something C++ possibly? Constructors could help with organization
 - Use a proper GUI
